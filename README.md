British Falconers Club Website Development

I developed a comprehensive website by seamlessly integrating React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Java for enhanced functionality. This multifaceted website encompassed various features, including seamless PayPal payment integration, robust data encryption to ensure security, an intuitive admin page, and a content management system (CMS) admin panel. By establishing a connection to a dedicated database, the website efficiently managed and retrieved data. This meticulous integration of technologies enabled a user-friendly interface while maintaining the highest standards of security and reliability, empowering users to interact effortlessly with the platform while safeguarding sensitive information.
