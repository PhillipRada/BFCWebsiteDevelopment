              <h2>New To Falconry</h2>
              <p>
                <a href="https://www.example.com/">New To Falconry</a> - If you
                are interested in taking up Falconry or working with Birds of
                Prey in another capacity then there are many things you need to
                know. The British Falconersâ€™ Club is dedicated to the welfare of
                birds of prey and provides help, advice and mentoring to all
                aspiring falconers regardless of your age or current level of
                experience. By contacting your nearest BFC Region you will find
                a ready source of help and advice about building accommodation,
                buying essential equipment and where to find your first Hawk.
                You will also be able to join the club on Field meets where you
                will see our Birds of Prey in action.

              <h2>Falconry Courses</h2>
              <p>
                <a href="http://raptorawards.co.uk/map/">FalconerTraining</a> -
                The BFC recommends that all new falconers study a formal course
                such as those provided by Raptor Awards or Lantra. The BFC does
                not provide falconry courses, but most regions have mentors in
                place to help you find the right path for you.
